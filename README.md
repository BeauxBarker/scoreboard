# Scoreboard

This is a simple scoreboard app built with vanilla JavaScript. This was one of the first JavaScript projects I developed. 
This project has not been refactored. Eventually, I would like to come back to the code to see how far I have come on my 
journey to learning. I was proud of my CSS and the time spent making the design. 
I would love to eventually create a 3D object with the same functionality.
